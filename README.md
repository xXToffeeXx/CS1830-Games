# CS1830-Games
## Callum's branch

game.py is this branch's current main file. It contains classes for the Player, Keyboard/Controls, Bullets, Enemies and Enemy Bullets.

The folder Old Files contains the files and code I had before I refactored my main file.

The folder New Main (Separate) contains my new main file, before merging with Sarah's game file.
