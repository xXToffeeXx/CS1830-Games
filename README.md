# CS1830-Games

Main is the main file currently focusing on Enemies both as a single unit and as a group (as well as all main functions and SimpleGUI frame stuff goes).

PlayerHandler is a file consisting of a Player class and Keyboard class, with very minimal features as they purely exist for testing purposes currently.

VectorHandler just contains the default Vector class
