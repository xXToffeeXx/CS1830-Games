Main is the main file currently focusing on enemies, enemies as a group and enemies shooting bullets.

PlayerHandler is a file consisting of a Player class and Keyboard class, with very minimal features as they purely exist for testing purposes currently.

cts is a file I am using for when I need constants in a number of different files, mainly between main and PlayerHandler.

FrameRate contains a SimpleGUI lib program to calculate and display ongoing FPS during the game, useful for testing.

VectorHandler just contains the default Vector class.

Sprite is a class to (hopefully) handle sprites and spritesheets. Still a WIP.
