This is probably a not so great way of organising files, but as I have code split up
into multiple locations, I figured it would be best to have global constants here
so that each file can take from it.

I might move all constants here in the future but for now all I need is these:
'''

WIN_WIDTH = 800
WIN_HEIGHT = 600
